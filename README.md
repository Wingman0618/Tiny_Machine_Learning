## Introduction
The project focuses on keyword spotting machine learning model development and the deployment on Aduino nano 33 BLE microcontroller.

The folder of *Keyword_spotting* contains the process of the model development, including the data pre-process , model training, model evaluation, and quantisation, based on tensorflow and tensorflow lite.

The folder of *arduino_deployments* contains the source files of model deployment on Arduino nano 33 BLE. 

Futher detials can be found in the folder description.
